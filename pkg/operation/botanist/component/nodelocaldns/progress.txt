-> In monitoring there is no alert rule like what if node local dns goes down (probably not required)
  -- I have returned nil

-> There is no logging present for node-local-dns
-> For flow dependecy for now followed the coreDns dependecy

-> Can we add annoatiaon later of node-local-dns or needed while creation(related to testing)

-> TODO in global (commit - Refactor ConfigMap template to Golang object, Refactor Service template to Golang object)
-> Todo common/types.go (commit - Refactor Deployment template to Golang object)

-> returning nil if node local dns is not enabled
-> verison conditions of the tets


---Todo
--In daemonset there is one config map missing as it is adding config annotations randomly 
-- Need extensive check on destroy 
-- Is extra test needed for nodelocaldns.go
